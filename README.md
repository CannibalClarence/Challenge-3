##Notes

I tried to get screen shots of all of the window prompts but for some reason my browser wont let me web capture when a window prompt is up.

I was having a problem where on my local "repo" I couldnt push or sync up to the romote repo. I kept getting the error code you do not have rights or acces to repo/ repo does not exist. so I created the repo remotely then I dragged and dropped all my files into it. I couldnt figure out what I did wrong being as I have had no problem with doing it on my other challenges or in my modules. so there are no commit messages due to this fact unfortunatly.
